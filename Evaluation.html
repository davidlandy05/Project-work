            <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
            <p>To evaluate my project, I believe it meets all requirements outlined in the brief. My system is an automated system that utilizes analogue input (steps/shake) and digital (sleep, hours worked, and mood) and outputs these digital and analogue values. It validates user inputs and then stores the information from the microbits onto Firebase. I have satisfied the analysis component as the system gets the average to make a prediction of the user's productivity at the current average daily number of steps and sleep. I manually added my dataset and created a model which is able to ask two what-if questions being: What if I get more sleep will it increase my productivity and improve wellbeing? and What if I increase steps how will it affect my mental wellbeing and productivity? Both my functions receive 7 validated parameters with two different data types being string and integer. The results give insight to the user if they are getting enough sleep and steps and the side effects of their current sleeping and steps habit. Finally, my app satisfies the third advanced requirement as my app graphs the daily average sleep, steps, mood, and productivity, a graph of your productivity on your longest hour of sleep compared to the lowest hours of sleep, and graph your sleep on your most active day compared to the lowest amount of exercise.</p>
            
            <h2>How it satify end user needs</h2>
            <p>The project helps to improve user wellbeing by showing them their daily averages and offering insight into whether they are getting enough exercise and steps, two essential aspects of wellbeing. If the user doesnâ€™t reach the recommended amount of sleep and steps, the system will tell the user how much they need to increase both to reach these goals. It also offers insight on the side effects of current habits.</p>
            
            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <p>In the future, a way to improve the system would be to allow the user to see their averages not only for daily but also for weekly and monthly so users can see the change in their habits. I would also add a feature where users could graphically compare their daily, weekly, and monthly stats to see if they are getting nearer to achieving their goal. Additionally, I would add a feature where users could reduce their hours in case they accidentally add too much by accident. Furthermore, I would let users add personal goals for their sleep, steps, and productivity as everyone has custom needs and the recommended average may not be what the end user wants to aim for.</p>
