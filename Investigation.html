        I initially decided to start my research by looking into wellbeing apps. The first app I looked at was tackles your feelings (tackle your feelings, 2015). I liked the idea that people could log how they were feeling each day and be able to then track this progress. I plan to implement this into my website. The next app I looked at for inspiration was Insight timer (Insight Network, Inc, 2020). I liked the system where you view your progress as you worked. I also researched sports Ireland (sports Ireland, 2014) where there initvative”Keep well” discusses the importance of tracking your mood and staying active. I decided to make a wellbeing app is for students to make schedule plans because as a student myself I understand how hard it is to maintain a schedule. They will be able to set goals of how much they work, sleep, exercise and track their mental health which helps improve user wellbeing. It can track your steps and the speed of your running to reach new speed goals. You can pick how many hours of exercise you want to do in a week and the app allows you to track your progress towards this goal. You can also track your mental wellbeing and hours of sleep. If you forget to log your results into the app it gives you a reminder over the day to remember to log your information from the day. The system will provide you with a recommendation of what schedule leads to the most productive and happy day. I realised I need to implement a system that can not only help track your goals and then also be able to see your progress as you work towards these goals. My system will meet the requirement by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Having an automated system that can track analogue (running speed) and digital (turning on tracking of running)</li>
        <li>The website will track information and store it on firebase</li>
        <li>The website will take your stats and then calculate an average of what schedule will produce the most productive day and tells you about its effect on your average mood</li>
        <li>The system will be able to track your general well-being and will be able to answer the what if questions:
            <ul>
                <li>What if I get more sleep will it increase my productivity and improve wellbeing? My website will allow you to track how long your worked and how long you slept and then show the user what hours of sleep lead to the most productive and happiest day.</li>
                <li>What if I increase steps how will it affect my mental wellbeing and productivity? My website allows the amount of exercise and then will show the user how their mood and hours of sleep were affected by an increase in exercise.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>My what if questions use 3 parameters being tracking mood(string), your hours of sleep(integer), and steps and be able to then reiterate these results back to the user.</li>
        <li>Website will display graphically which will display convert this to be shown on an HTML webpage.</li>
    </ul>
